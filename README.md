# E-handy

## Abstract
At the beginning of the project, we envision a system that would become an industry standard for network expansion. We wanted a website that would deliver on a promise to ease the pain of finding suitable professionals, who are dedicated to their role. This came in a form of a database implementation implanted within a CSS/HTML webpage. The webpage would request and retrieve valuable contact informations for the user's convenience.
Throughout the development process, the team implemented many software architecture design that was vital to the production of the website. Through these processes, the team learned so much about cooperation and teammate reliance among each other as well as integrating architectural diagram for a professional simulation of a company.

BACKGROUND
This project began with 4 people and an idea. Like many origin stories, this idea slowly formed into a tangible thing. Our idea was to create a local directory website for home service businesses. This website allowed homeowners to search and connect easily with trusted businesses with neighbor reviews and ratings. The services available would be vetted through our website administrators to ensure a safe and easy experience. Our hope with this website is to take the work out of house work.

## Goals

## Requirements

## Solution Qualities
In this project, we had a set requirement that needs to be done and adhered by.  The following requirements were our main focus throughout the project.


## User Experience Design
In order to create an appealing and successful product, we needed to pay close attention to our intended users and their interactions with the productâ€™s interface. By targeting specific user personas, we can study their perspectives, their behaviors, and how to design our interface with their experience in mind.

This UX process and analysis led us to iterative improvements upon our UI. We focused in on two key user archetypes, each representing a different side of the eHandy experience that we envisioned. With these two representative users in mind, we laid out the actions required to perform the tasks the users need and designed our interface to make accessing these actions clear and consistent.


## Architecture
In our front end, we used HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript, to handle some harder animations. We did not use any frameworks or templates. Our reason behind this was because our lack of understanding of these languages. By starting off from nothing, we were able to learn and customize these languages to our taste. HTML layed out our framework while CSS and JavaScript spiced up our website with color schemes, animations, and positioning. 

For our back end, we used JavaScript and PHP. PHP was used to contact our server to MySQL. PHP handled our database interactions as well as our user sessions to signup and login. Javascript played an important role to handle these PHP requests. We used the Ajax library to run php without refreshing the page. As a result, our website had a clean transition to displaying information grabbed from MySQL.

Finally, in our server side, we used Linux Server, Apache2 and MySQL. Because we are hosting the website from our home desktop, we used a Linux Server with Apache2 to redirect incoming ports to our page. On the same system, we ran MySQL to store our database for businesses and homeowners. MySQL was also used to handle and store user sessions.
