# Abstract
At the beginning of the project, we envision a system that would become an industry standard for network expansion. We wanted a website that would deliver on a promise to ease the pain of finding suitable professionals, who are dedicated to their role. This came in a form of a database implementation implanted within a CSS/HTML webpage. The webpage would request and retrieve valuable contact informations for the user's convenience.
Throughout the development process, the team implemented many software architecture design that was vital to the production of the website. Through these processes, the team learned so much about cooperation and teammate reliance among each other as well as integrating architectural diagram for a professional simulation of a company.

# Background
This project began with 4 people and an idea. Like many origin stories, this idea slowly formed into a tangible thing. Our idea was to create a local directory website for home service businesses. This website allowed homeowners to search and connect easily with trusted businesses with neighbor reviews and ratings. The services available would be vetted through our website administrators to ensure a safe and easy experience. Our hope with this website is to take the work out of house work.
